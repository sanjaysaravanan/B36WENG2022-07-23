  sync & async operation

  Callback Hell

  Promise: Object representation eventual completion of async operation
    states -> pending (started/initial), rejected ( fail to complete ), fullfilled ( success/desired output ).
    Accessing Values of Promise:
    Promise Chaining
  
Topics:

  Promise all()
    combining multiple promise into a single promise resolve give the accumulates fullfill results of all the promises reject gives on which failed

  API ---> Application Program Interface
    what is REST API -> Representational State Transfer API
      Communication between servers

  JSON - Javascript Object Notation

  fetch

    fetch API ---> Fetch is used to read data / or do an http operation
      which return a promise with response containing the readable stream
      Handle by .then & .catch

  disadvantage of promise:
    Too much of Chaining leads to uncertain

  async and await:
    async & await --> 
      1. async keyword is used before a function which does asynchronous operations.
      2. which makes the functions to wait for asynchronous action until there resoltion/rejection using await

  1. Publics APIs
    Look for You requirement & Choose a type of API
    Use APIs which has HTTPS & CORS enabled
    If Signing is fine Go for Auth, HTTPS, CORS enabled

    Read the Documentation Test the API before choosing it

  2. Implementation of DOM manipulation examples
    1. Email Verify examples
    2. Get City weather examples

  intro to public APIs ---> Choose public APIs based on the API_key, Https, Cors
